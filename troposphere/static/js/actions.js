// Note: while we could include all the actions here, I'm not going to
// instead, I'm going to let the application load the actions it needs
// to use during the bootstrapping process so that the application
// will throw exceptions if any actions don't exist (which will be the default
// state for functional tests that need mocked actions)

export default {
    // add actions here
