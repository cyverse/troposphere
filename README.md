Troposphere
===========

## Development

### Quick feedback

The `webpack-dev-server` will serve new bundles to a browser when files
change.

It has the following features:

- Changes result in a browser refresh (you know they are propagated)
- The bundle is served from memory not disk
- Small changes result in small compiles

Currently troposphere uses nginx to serve its assets. This makes it trivial to
serve these assets from the dev server.

Update your nginx definition (at `/etc/nginx/locations/tropo.conf`)
```nginx
location /assets {
    # This just needs to point to the dev server which runs on 8080
    proxy_pass https://atmo.local.cloud:8080;
}
```

Finally start the dev server:
```bash
npm run serve -- --cert /path/to/cert --key /path/to/key
```

### Linting

See `LINT.md`

### Coding Style

- Use an [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/) plugin to leverage the project's `.editorconfig`

#### Git Hooks
The hooks below give helpful hints about common tasks like migrating, or
installing dependencies.

Link the following hook to get these hints after pulling in code.
From the root of the project:
```bash
ln -fs ../../extras/hooks/post-merge.hook .git/hooks/post-merge
```
